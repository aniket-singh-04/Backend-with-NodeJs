// bcrypt vs bcrypt.js
// bcrypt it uses the c++ behing the sean and it is very fast it work on the nodejs it not work on browser because is browser on understand the c++ 
// bcryptJs it is in pure js it is slighter slow and it work on browser 
// bcryptJs library use to hash at the ui level of password

console.log(hashed)

// bcrypt uses Blowfish internally,
// Blowfish is a symmetric key block cipher, designed for speed and secure data encryption. It breaks data down into fixed block-size chunks and then scrambles it repeatedly using a secret key to guide the process.
// It’s highly versatile because it allows a choice of key sizes ranging from 32 to 448 bits. This means users can balance speed and security.
