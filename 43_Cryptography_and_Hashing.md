# 🛡️ Introduction to Cryptography

Cryptography is the art and science of securing data by transforming it into a format that can only be understood by authorized parties. It ensures **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **authentication**, and **non-repudiation** of information.

## 🔐 Types of Cryptography

### 1. **Encryption (Reversible)**

Encryption is the process of converting data into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. It can be reversed using a **key**.

#### Common Algorithms:

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- DES (Data Encryption Standard)

#### ✍️ Terminology in Encryption/Decryption

| Term               | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plaintext**      | The original readable message or data.                                    |
| **Ciphertext**     | The encrypted, unreadable version of the plaintext.                       |
| **Encryption**     | The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a key.          |
| **Decryption**     | The process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext using a key.       |
| **Key**            | A secret value used in encryption and decryption.                         |
| **Symmetric Key**  | The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.                  |
| **Asymmetric Key** | A key pair: public key (for encryption) and private key (for decryption). |

### 2. **Hashing (Irreversible)**

Hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-size bits, which typically represents a digest of that data. It is **one-way**, meaning it cannot be reversed.

#### Common Algorithms:

- SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)
- MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm) (Obsolete)
- SHA-1 (Obsolete)

#### ✍️ Terminology in Hashing

| Term              | Description                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Message**       | The original input data (e.g., a password, file, or string).           |
| **Hash / Digest** | The fixed-length output generated by the hashing algorithm.            |
| **Hash Function** | The algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size output. |
| **Collision**     | When two different inputs produce the same hash (undesirable).         |
| **Salt**          | Random data added to input to prevent hash-based attacks.              |

## 🧠 Summary

- Use **encryption** when you want to recover the original data later.
- Use **hashing** when you only want to verify data integrity or store secrets like passwords.
- Always choose strong, modern algorithms and avoid outdated ones like MD5 or SHA-1.

Cryptography is a foundational part of modern cybersecurity and essential for protecting digital information.









# 🔐 Understanding Hashing

## ⚙️ What is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of converting any binary input (like a string, file, or data) into a fixed-size output of **bytes** using a mathematical function called a **hash function**. This output is typically represented as a string of hexadecimal characters, but fundamentally, the size is in bytes.

## 🔒 Why is Hashing Used?

Hashing has many applications in computer science and cyber security:

- **Data Integrity Checks**: Hashes verify that data has not been altered (e.g., file checksums).
- **Version Control**: Hashes are used to uniquely identify commits, files, and changes, ensuring integrity and traceability.
- **Digital Signatures**: Hashes ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital messages.
- **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed before being stored in databases to prevent plaintext exposure.
- **Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies**: Blocks and transactions are hashed to secure and verify data.

### ✨ Characteristics of Cryptographically Secure Hashing Functions:

- **Deterministic**: Same input always gives the same output.
- **Fast Computation**: The hash function should return the hash value quickly.
- **Irreversible**: It should not be feasible to reverse the hash to get the original input.
- **Collision-resistant**: Two different inputs should not produce the same output.
- **Avalanche Effect**: Small change in input produces a significantly different output.

## 🧪 Popular and Secure Hashing Algorithms

### 1. **SHA-2 Family**

- Includes **SHA-224**, **SHA-256**, **SHA-384**, and **SHA-512**.
- Produces fixed output sizes of 224, 256, 384, or 512 bits (28, 32, 48, or 64 bytes).
- Widely used in modern cryptographic applications.
- Considered secure and recommended for most general-purpose use cases.

### 2. **SHA-3 Family**

- Includes **SHA3-224**, **SHA3-256**, **SHA3-384**, and **SHA3-512**.
- Based on the Keccak algorithm.
- Provides the same output sizes as SHA-2 but with a different internal structure.
- Designed to be a secure alternative to SHA-2 in case SHA-2 is ever broken.

## ⚠️ Outdated and Insecure Hashing Algorithms

### 1. **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**

- Outputs 128-bit (16-byte) hash.
- **Broken and insecure** due to collision vulnerabilities.
- Should not be used for any security-critical purpose.

### 2. **SHA 1**

- Outputs 160-bit (20-byte) hash.
- Vulnerable to collision attacks.
- Deprecated by major standards organizations and not recommended for use.

## 📊 Summary

| Algorithm | Output Size | Status   | Use Case                           |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| MD5       | 128 bits    | Insecure | Basic checksums only               |
| SHA-1     | 160 bits    | Insecure | Legacy systems                     |
| SHA-224   | 224 bits    | Secure   | Specialized use cases              |
| SHA-256   | 256 bits    | Secure   | General-purpose hashing            |
| SHA-384   | 384 bits    | Secure   | Applications needing larger hashes |
| SHA-512   | 512 bits    | Secure   | High-security applications         |
| SHA3-224  | 224 bits    | Secure   | SHA-3 alternative to SHA-224       |
| SHA3-256  | 256 bits    | Secure   | SHA-3 alternative to SHA-256       |
| SHA3-384  | 384 bits    | Secure   | SHA-3 alternative to SHA-384       |
| SHA3-512  | 512 bits    | Secure   | SHA-3 alternative to SHA-512       |

Avoid using MD5 and SHA-1 in any new systems. For secure hashing, use SHA-2 or SHA-3 family algorithms depending on your needs.

# File Hashing Guide with SHA-256

This guide explains how to hash files using SHA-256 on different platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux. It also demonstrates a cross-platform method using `openssl`.

---

## ✅ Hashing Files on Windows with `certutil`

`certutil` is a built-in tool on Windows that can be used to generate SHA-256 hashes.

### Example:

```bash
certutil -hashfile path/to/file.txt SHA256
```

Hash as string input.
```bash
echo Hello World > temp.txt
certutil -hashfile temp.txt SHA256
rm temp.txt
```

List supported algorithms and commands.

```bash
certutil -hashfile -?
```

---

## ✅ Alternative for macOS and Linux: `shasum`

macOS and most Linux distributions come with `shasum` pre-installed.

### Example:

```bash
shasum -a 256 path/to/file.txt
```

Hash as string input.
```bash
echo -n "Hello World" | shasum -a 256 path/to/file.txt
#-n used to prevent the (\n) which are present in the Hello World
```

List supported algorithms and commands.

```bash
shasum -h
```

---

## ✅ Cross-Platform Method: Using `openssl`

`openssl` is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and provides a consistent way to generate hashes.

### Example:

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256 path/to/file.txt
```

Hash as string input.

```bash
echo -n "Hello World" | openssl dgst -sha256
#-n used to prevent the (\n) which are present in the Hello World
```
